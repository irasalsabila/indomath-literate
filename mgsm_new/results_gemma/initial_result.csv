Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step to determine how many years it will take Soni to profit from his lemon tree.

1. **Calculate the annual revenue from the lemons:** Soni gets 7 lemons per year and sells each for $1.50.  So, his annual revenue is 7 lemons * $1.50/lemon = $10.50.

2. **Calculate the annual net profit:**  He earns $10.50 in revenue but spends $3 on maintenance.  His annual net profit is $10.50 - $3 = $7.50.

3. **Calculate the number of years to recover the initial cost:** The initial cost of the tree is $90. He makes $7.50 per year. To find out how many years it takes to recover the cost, divide the initial cost by the annual net profit: $90 / $7.50 = 12 years.

Therefore, it will take Soni 12 years to start making a profit from the lemon tree.

Jika Lina memiliki 5 penyedot debu tersisa, berapa banyak yang dia miliki saat memulai?",18,"Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

Let 'x' be the original number of vacuum cleaners Lina had.

*   She sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners at the greenhouse:  x/3
*   She sold 2 vacuum cleaners to the red house: 2
*   She sold 1/2 of her vacuum cleaners to the orange house: x/2
*   She has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

The total number of vacuum cleaners sold plus the remaining ones equals the original number of vacuum cleaners:

x/3 + 2 + x/2 + 5 = x

Now, let's solve for x:

First, combine the constants: 2 + 5 = 7

So we have: x/3 + x/2 + 7 = x

Next, find a common denominator for the fractions (6):

2x/6 + 3x/6 + 7 = x

Combine the fraction terms: 5x/6 + 7 = x

Subtract 5x/6 from both sides: 7 = x - 5x/6

Rewrite x as 6x/6: 7 = 6x/6 - 5x/6

Simplify: 7 = x/6

Multiply both sides by 6: 7 * 6 = x

So, x = 42

Therefore, Lina started with 42 vacuum cleaners.

3. **Set up an equation:** Let 'x' be the original price.  We can write the equation: 0.75 * x = $19.50

4. **Solve for x:** To find x, divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
   x = $19.50 / 0.75

5. **Calculate the original price:**  $19.50 / 0.75 = $26

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.

Yang lain menjawab 20 lebih banyak dari setengah toples pertama. Yang ketiga menjawab 25% lebih banyak dari toples pertama. Berapa perkiraan rata-rata mereka?,80,"Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **First friend's estimate:** The first friend estimated 80 jelly beans.

2. **Second friend's estimate:** The second friend estimated ""20 more than half the first estimate"". Half of the first estimate is 80 / 2 = 40.  20 more than this is 40 + 20 = 60.

3. **Third friend's estimate:** The third friend estimated ""25% more than the first estimate"". 25% of the first estimate is 0.25 * 80 = 20.  25% more than the first estimate is 80 + 20 = 100.

4. **Total estimate:** To find the total of all the estimates, we add them together: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

2,jv,Jubah njupuk 2 baut serat biru lan setengah saka serat putih. Carane akeh bolts ing total njupuk?,3,"Okay, let's break down this problem. The question is in Indonesian. Here's a translation and then the step-by-step solution:

**Translation:**

""Jubah takes 2 blue fiber bolts and half of the white fiber bolts. How many bolts does he take in total?""

Essentially, we need more information to answer this question.  We *know* Jubah takes 2 blue bolts, but we don't know how many white bolts there *are* to begin with.  The problem states ""half of the white fiber bolts,"" but doesn't tell us the initial amount.

Because the problem doesn't define how many white bolts there are, we can't determine the total number of bolts. Therefore, the problem is unanswerable without additional data.

**CoT (Chain of Thought):**

1. **Identify known quantities:** Jubah takes 2 blue bolts.
2. **Identify unknown quantities:** The number of white bolts is unknown.  We only know Jubah takes *half* of them.
3. **Define the operation needed:** To find the total, we need to add the number of blue bolts to the number of white bolts (2 + (number of white bolts / 2)).
4. **Recognize missing information:**  We cannot compute ""number of white bolts / 2"" without knowing the ""number of white bolts"".
5. **Conclusion:** The problem cannot be solved due to insufficient information.

The problem is unsolvable because the number of white bolts is not provided. We only know Jubah takes half of them, but without knowing the total number of white bolts, we can't determine the number he took or the overall total.

1. **Calculate the total investment:** Najwa spent $80,000 on the house and $50,000 on repairs, so her total investment is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

2. **Calculate the selling price:** The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the selling price is the original price *plus* 150% of the original price.  However, the 150% increase is relative to the *purchase* price, not the total spent. So we are looking for a selling price that is 150% *above* the $80,000 purchase price.

  Increase in value = 150% of $80,000 = 1.50 * $80,000 = $120,000
  Selling Price = Original Price + Increase = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

3. **Calculate the profit:**  Profit is the selling price minus the total investment.
  Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, Najwa's profit is $70,000.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Calculate the amount of data downloaded before the interruption:** 40% of 200 GB = 0.40 * 200 GB = 80 GB

2. **Calculate the time taken to download the 80 GB:** Time = Data / Rate = 80 GB / (2 GB/minute) = 40 minutes

3. **Add the update installation time:** Total time so far = 40 minutes (download) + 20 minutes (update) = 60 minutes

4. **Calculate the remaining data to download:** Remaining data = 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB:** Time = Data / Rate = 120 GB / (2 GB/minute) = 60 minutes

6. **Calculate the total download time:** Total time = Time for first part + Update time + Time for second part = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

**2. Return Journey - First 2 Hours (Traffic):**

*   Distance covered = 0 miles (Stuck in traffic. We assume no progress towards home).

**3. Return Journey - Next 0.5 Hours:**

**4. Return Journey - Remaining Time:**

*   Total return time = 4 hours
*   Time spent in traffic = 2 hours
*   Time spent at 30 mph = 0.5 hours
*   Remaining time = 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours
*   Distance covered = 80 mph x 1.5 hours = 120 miles

**5. Total Distance Returned:**

*   Total distance returned = 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

""Lina is a salesperson from home. She sold one-third of the vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what remained at the orange house. If Lina still has 5 vacuum cleaners, how many did she start with?""

**Step 1: Work backwards from the end.**

Lina has 5 vacuum cleaners *after* selling some at the orange house. This means the 5 represents the amount *remaining* after the orange house sale.  The sale at the orange house was half of what was left *before* that sale.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners *before* the orange house sale.**

If 5 vacuum cleaners represent half of what was left before the orange house, then before the orange house sale, she had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners.

**Step 3: Work backwards to the red house sale.**

Before selling to the red house, there were 10 vacuum cleaners. She sold 2 to the red house. Therefore, before the red house sale, she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.

**Step 4: Work backwards to the green house sale.**

Before selling to the green house, there were 12 vacuum cleaners. She sold 1/3 (one-third) of the original amount at the green house. Let 'x' be the original number of vacuum cleaners. Then, 12 represents 2/3 of the original amount, since she sold 1/3.

So, (2/3) * x = 12

**Step 5: Solve for x.**

Therefore, Lina originally had 18 vacuum cleaners.

1. **Calculate the volume of water in the orange drink initially:** The orange drink is 10 liters and 2/3 of it is water. So, the amount of water in the orange drink is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 liters.

2. **Calculate the volume of orange juice:**  Since 2/3 is water, 1/3 is orange juice. So the amount of orange juice is (1/3) * 10 = 10/3 liters.

3. **Calculate the volume of water spilled:** 1 liter of the orange drink was spilled. Since the drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water spilled is (2/3) * 1 = 2/3 liters.

4. **Calculate the remaining orange drink:** After spilling 1 liter, there are 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left.

5. **Calculate the remaining water in the orange drink:** The remaining water in the orange drink is (20/3) - (2/3) = 18/3 = 6 liters.

6. **Calculate the volume of water in the pineapple drink:** The pineapple drink is 15 liters and 3/5 of it is water. So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters.

7. **Calculate the total volume of the mixture:** The total volume of the remaining orange drink and pineapple drink is 9 + 15 = 24 liters.

8. **Calculate the total amount of water in the mixture:** The total amount of water in the mixture is 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

Therefore, the total amount of water in the 24 liters of drink that remains is 15 liters.

1. **Understand the problem:** The book was sold for $19.50 *after* a 25% discount was applied.  We need to find the original price *before* the discount.

2. **Represent the original price:** Let 'x' represent the original price of the book.

A third says 25% more than the first one. What is their average guess?,80,"Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem, following a Chain of Thought (CoT) approach:

1. **Friend 1's guess:** The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.

2. **Friend 2's guess:**  The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess.  Half of 80 is 80 / 2 = 40.  20 more than 40 is 40 + 20 = 60.  So, the second friend guesses 60.

3. **Friend 3's guess:** The third friend guesses 25% *more* than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is (25/100) * 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20. 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100. So, the third friend guesses 100.

4. **Calculate the total of all guesses:** The total of the three guesses is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

**Understanding the Problem:**

The problem states that Umar has a total of 110 coins (dhuwit recehan). We also know that he has 30 more gold coins (dhuwit recehan emas) than silver coins (dhuwit recehan perak).  We need to find out how many gold coins Umar has.

**Step 1: Define Variables**

* Let 'x' represent the number of silver coins (dhuwit recehan perak).
* Then, the number of gold coins (dhuwit recehan emas) is 'x + 30'.

**Step 2: Set up an Equation**

The total number of coins is the sum of gold and silver coins:
x + (x + 30) = 110

**Step 3: Solve the Equation**

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

So, Umar has 40 silver coins.

**Step 4: Calculate the Number of Gold Coins**

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate Bagas's total earnings from selling Lego:** He sold 13 sets of Lego at $15 each, so he earned 13 * $15 = $195.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the video games:** He bought 8 video games at $20 each, so they cost 8 * $20 = $160.

3. **Calculate how much money Bagas had before buying the video games:** He had $160 (spent on games) + $5 (remaining) = $165.

4. **Check if the calculations are correct:** He was supposed to earn $195 from selling the Lego sets. He only had $165. This is a contradiction. Let's re-examine the prompt. The problem states Bagas 'planned to sell *all* his toys' and use the money for video games. It then states he sold *13 sets of lego*. The question is 'how many lego sets does he have *left*?'. Therefore, we must acknowledge the incorrectness of the assumption that he sold all his toys simply because the problem states he planned to. 

5. **Recognize the initial statement about selling all toys is irrelevant:** The prompt states he started with SOME lego sets, then SOLD 13, and ended with money *after* buying the games. We need to look at how many he started with

6. **Now we need to infer how many lego sets Bagas *started* with**: We use the information that he sold 13 sets, and this is the only information that directly relates to Legos. Since the question is how many are left, it must be that the initial 13 sets, as stated, are the set of toys he sold. This implies he had more than 13. The question is flawed

7. **Reframe the question** Assume the intent of the problem is as follows: ""Bagas has a collection of lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets for $15 each. He uses the money to buy 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 remaining. How much money did he start with?"" To answer that, we follow steps 1, 2, and 3.

8. **If the question is as originally stated** (how many sets are left, after selling 13), then the question is flawed. Let's assume the intent of the question is to ask ""how many Lego sets did Bagas sell?"".

Since the question is not properly set up, we can look at the plea of the question, which is how many Lego sets did Bagas sell?

**Translation:**

""Bagas walks 60 miles per week. He walks 3 days a week. He walks 3 hours on the first day and half as much more than the other two days. How fast does he run?""

**Important Note:** The problem *says* ""walks"" (mlaku), but asks ""how fast does he *run*?"" This is likely a typo or a trick. We'll proceed assuming ""run"" is meant to be ""walk"" and calculate speed.  We'll calculate speed/pace based on distance and *time*.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Total distance:** Bagas walks 60 miles per week.

2. **Days of walking:** He walks for 3 days.

3. **Time on the first day:** He walks for 3 hours on the first day.

4. **Time on the other days:** He walks ""half as much more"" than those 3 hours on the other two days.  This means on each of the other two days, he walks 3 + (0.5 * 3) = 3 + 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

5. **Total time:** Total walking time per week is 3 hours (day 1) + 4.5 hours (day 2) + 4.5 hours (day 3) = 12 hours.

6. **Speed:** Speed = Distance / Time.  Therefore, his speed is 60 miles / 12 hours = 5 miles per hour.

1. **Find Desi's walking speed:** Desi jumps at 3 mph, which is half the speed of running.  So, Desi's running speed is 3 mph * 2 = 6 mph.  Desi walks four times slower than running, therefore Desi walks at 6 mph / 4 = 1.5 mph.

2. **Calculate walking time:** Desi spends 1/3 of the 6 hours walking.  That's (1/3) * 6 hours = 2 hours.

3. **Calculate jumping time:** Desi spends 2/3 of the 6 hours jumping. That's (2/3) * 6 hours = 4 hours.

4. **Calculate distance walked:** Distance = Speed * Time.  Desi walks for 2 hours at 1.5 mph, so the distance walked is 1.5 mph * 2 hours = 3 miles.

5. **Calculate distance jumped:**  Desi jumps for 4 hours at 3 mph, so the distance jumped is 3 mph * 4 hours = 12 miles.

6. **Calculate total distance:** Total distance = Distance walked + Distance jumped = 3 miles + 12 miles = 15 miles.

Therefore, Desi can travel 15 miles in six hours.

Yen nyekel watu permata, nganti tekan njaba geni naga bisa ngadeg Polly lan isih nabrak naga nganggo lembing emas?",200,"
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**1. Understand the Problem:**

We have a dragon (Naga gedhe) with a fire breath range of 1000 feet.  Polly has a golden javelin with a normal range of 400 feet that can pierce the dragon. The javelin can reach the dragon's fire.  A sapphire gem triples Polly's javelin throwing distance.  We need to determine if Polly, *while holding the gem*, can throw the javelin far enough to hit the dragon *despite* being within the dragon's fire range and needing to somehow avoid the fire.

**2. Calculate Polly's Javelin Range with the Gem:**

* Normal javelin range: 400 feet
* Range with gem: 400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet

**3. Determine Polly's Distance to the Dragon:**

The problem states the dragon is on top of Mount Farbo and breathing fire in all directions within 1000 feet. For Polly to *potentially* hit the dragon, she must be *within* the 1000-foot fire range.

**4. Assess if the increased range is sufficient:**

Polly's javelin range *with* the sapphire is 1200 feet. Since the dragon's fire range is 1000 feet, and Polly can reach the fire with the javelin, Polly can reach a position far enough that the javelin can travel 1200 feet and still hit the dragon. 

**5. Considering it all:**

The question asks if Polly can *stand* (i.e., survive) and throw a javelin that hits the dragon.  Since the javelin can reach the fire, and Polly's range with the sapphire is greater than the fire range, Polly could maintain a distance of 1000 feet from the dragon (maximum fire range). Polly could stand safely *just outside* the fire, and throw the javelin to hit the dragon.

**Final Answer:**

```
Ya, Polly bisa ngadeg lan isih nabrak naga nganggo lembing emas.
```
(Yes, Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the golden javelin.)",0.0,False

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total slices:** Mbah Nisa baked 5 apple pies and cut each into 8 slices.  So, the total number of slices is 5 pies * 8 slices/pie = 40 slices.

2. **Slices remaining:** After the guests ate some pie, there were 14 slices left.

3. **Slices taken:** To find out how many slices the guests took, subtract the remaining slices from the total slices: 40 slices - 14 slices = 26 slices.

Therefore, the guests took 26 slices of pie.

1. **Calculate total calories in the bag:** The bag has 5 portions, and each portion has 250 calories, so the total calories in the bag are 5 * 250 = 1250 calories.

2. **Calculate remaining calories:**  The daily target is 2000 calories, and 1800 have already been consumed, leaving 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories remaining.

3. **Calculate the number of portions allowed:** With 200 calories remaining, and each portion being 250 calories, we can eat 200 / 250 = 0.8 portions.

4. **Calculate the weight of allowed portions:**  The bag has 300g and 5 portions.  So one portion weighs 300g / 5 = 60g.  We can eat 0.8 portions, so the allowed weight is 0.8 * 60g = 48g.

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

1. **Initial notes:** The person started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Notes used at the office:** The person used 1 Post-it note for each of 220 cups of coffee, so they used 220 notes.
3. **Total notes used:** The person used a total of 80 (initial) + notes used at office = 220 notes.
4. **Notes remaining before buying more:**  The person had 23 notes remaining, so they spent 80 - 220 + 23 = -117 notes. This is a contradiction so let's reexamine. The person started with 80 notes, and put them *in* their wallet before going to the coffee shop. They later bought *more* notes.
5. **Notes used before the purchase:** The person used 80 notes before buying more.
6. **Remaining notes after office usage:** The person had 23 notes left after using some at the office. This means 80 + x - 220 = 23, where x is the number of notes in the package they bought.

**1. Understand the Problem:**

*   Bagas buys red ties, and the weight of the red ties is twice the weight of the blue ties. (Weight is not relevant to the cost, so we can ignore it)
*   The price of a red tie is 50% higher than the price of a blue tie.
*   Bagas spends $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.
*   We need to find the total amount of money Bagas spent on red ties.

**2. Calculate the Number of Blue Ties:**

*   Total spent on blue ties: $200
*   Price per blue tie: $40
*   Number of blue ties: $200 / $40 = 5

**3. Calculate the Price of a Red Tie:**

*   Price of a blue tie: $40
*   Red tie price is 50% higher: $40 + (50/100 * $40) = $40 + $20 = $60

**4. Determine the Number of Red Ties:**

The problem states ""dasi abang kaping pindho tinimbang dasi biru"" or the weight of the red ties is twice the weight of the blue ties.
We can assume this implies Bagas purchased twice as many red ties as blue ties.

*   Number of blue ties: 5
*   Number of red ties: 5 * 2 = 10

**5. Calculate the Total Cost of Red Ties:**

*   Number of red ties: 10

The question is in Sundanese, but we can translate the relevant parts to understand the problem:

*   **Bagas drove for 3 hours at 60 mph:** This tells us how far he initially traveled *away* from home.
*   **He turned around because he forgot something important:** This starts the return journey.
*   **He tried to get home in 4 hours:** This is the time he allocated for the return trip.
*   **First 2 hours in traffic:**  He didn't make much progress during this time.
*   **Next 30 minutes (0.5 hours) at 30 mph:** He traveled at a slower speed.
*   **Remaining time at 80 mph:** He drove the rest of the time at a faster speed.
*   **How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?** This is what we need to figure out.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1.  **Distance traveled *away* from home:**
    Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 3 hours = 180 miles.

2.  **Calculate the return time excluding traffic and the 30mph segment:**
    Total return time = 4 hours
    Traffic time = 2 hours
    30 mph time = 0.5 hours
    Remaining time = 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours

3.  **Distance traveled during traffic:**
    Since he was stuck in traffic, we'll assume his speed was 0 mph. Distance = 0 mph x 2 hours = 0 miles.

4.  **Distance traveled at 30 mph:**
    Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 0.5 hours = 15 miles

5.  **Distance traveled at 80 mph:**
    Distance = Speed x Time = 80 mph x 1.5 hours = 120 miles

6.  **Total distance traveled *towards* home:**
    Total distance = 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles

7.  **Calculate the final distance from home:**
    Initial distance from home = 180 miles
    Distance traveled towards home = 135 miles
    Final distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

Therefore, Bagas is 45 miles from home at the end of the 4 hours.

   Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. **Calculate overtime hours:** Elisa worked 45 hours total and 40 are regular, so she worked overtime.
   Overtime hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

3. **Calculate overtime rate:** Elisa's overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.
   Overtime rate = $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

4. **Calculate overtime pay:**  Elisa earns $12/hour for her 5 overtime hours.
   Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

5. **Calculate total earnings:**  Add her regular pay and overtime pay to find her total earnings.
   Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Elisa's total earnings for the week are $460.

**1. Understand the problem:**

The problem asks for the total number of downloads of a program over three months. We're given the downloads for the first month, and information on how the downloads change in the subsequent months.

**2. Calculate downloads in the second month:**

* Downloads in the first month: 60
* Downloads in the second month are three times the first month: 60 * 3 = 180

**3. Calculate downloads in the third month:**

* Downloads in the second month: 180
* Reduction in the third month: 30% of 180 = 0.30 * 180 = 54
* Downloads in the third month: 180 - 54 = 126

**4. Calculate total downloads over three months:**

* Total downloads = Downloads (month 1) + Downloads (month 2) + Downloads (month 3)
* Total downloads = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366

**1. Calculate the annual revenue from the lemons:**

*   Soni sells each lemon for $1.50.
*   He harvests 7 lemons per year.
*   Annual revenue = 7 lemons * $1.50/lemon = $10.50

**2. Calculate the total annual cost of maintaining the tree:**

*   Water and fertilizer cost $3 per year.

**3. Calculate the annual net profit (or loss):**

Okay, let's break down this Indonesian word problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Problem:**

Lina sells vacuum cleaners door-to-door. We know how many she sold to different colored houses and how many she had left. We need to figure out how many she *started* with.

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' be the total number of vacuum cleaners Lina started with.

**Translate the Information into Equations:**

* **Green Houses:** She sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners to green houses:  x/3
* **Red Houses:** She sold 2 vacuum cleaners to red houses: +2
* **Orange Houses:** She sold 1/2 of what was *left* to orange houses.  This is the tricky part! Let's figure out what was left *before* the orange house sale.

**Calculate what was left after selling to green and red houses:**

*  Remaining after Green:  x - (x/3) = (2/3)x
* Remaining after Red: (2/3)x - 2

**Orange Houses Sale:**

* She sold 1/2 of the remaining vacuum cleaners to orange houses: (1/2) * [(2/3)x - 2]
* This simplifies to (1/3)x - 1

**Final Remaining Vacuum Cleaners:**

*  After selling to the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. This means:
   [(2/3)x - 2] - [(1/3)x - 1] = 5

**Solve for x:**

1. Simplify the equation:  (2/3)x - 2 - (1/3)x + 1 = 5
2. Combine like terms: (1/3)x - 1 = 5
3. Add 1 to both sides: (1/3)x = 6
4. Multiply both sides by 3: x = 18

**Answer:**

Lina started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time to achieve the desired average speed.**

*   Total distance = 12 miles
*   Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
*   Total time = Total distance / Average speed = 12 miles / 4 mph = 3 hours

**Step 2: Calculate the time already spent walking.**

*   Time for the first 4 miles = 1 hour
*   Time for the next 2 miles = 1 hour
*   Total time spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining time.**

*   Remaining time = Total time - Time spent = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance.**

*   Distance already walked = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
*   Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance walked = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

**Step 5: Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance.**

*   Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 mph

    * 1 liter of orange juice was poured out.

4. **Calculate the amount of orange juice remaining:**
    * Original orange juice: 10 liters
    * Orange juice poured out: 1 liter
    * Remaining orange juice: 10 - 1 = 9 liters

5. **Calculate the water in the remaining orange juice:**

**1. Understand the Ratio:**

The question states that the ratio of Dani's age to Angga's age is 7:11.  This means for every 7 units of Dani's age, Angga has 11 units of age.

**2. Find the Value of One Unit:**

The total of the ratio parts is 7 + 11 = 18.
The total age of both Dani and Angga is 162 years.
Therefore, one unit of the ratio is equal to 162 / 18 = 9 years.

**3. Calculate Angga's Current Age:**

Angga's age is represented by 11 units.  So, Angga's current age is 11 * 9 = 99 years.

**4. Calculate Angga's Age in 10 Years:**

Angga's age in 10 years will be 99 + 10 = 109 years.

1. **Understand the problem:** Umar has 110 coins in total, consisting of gold and silver coins. The number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins. We need to find the number of gold coins.

2. **Define variables:**
   * Let 'x' be the number of silver coins.
   * Then, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'.

3. **Set up an equation:** The total number of coins is the sum of gold and silver coins:
   x + (x + 30) = 110

4. **Solve the equation:**
   2x + 30 = 110
   2x = 110 - 30
   2x = 80
   x = 40  (This is the number of silver coins)

**1. Understand the Problem:**

*   Tukimin sells yogurt.
*   He initially had 2 yogurts (sapoé - likely means 'each'). We'll assume this means he *starts* with needing 2 yogurts per day.
*   Yogurts are sold at a price of 4 for $5.00.

1. **Total running time:** We need to figure out Bagas's total running time each week.  He runs 3 days a week and we are given the duration for one of those days.

2. **Running time on other days:** The problem states he runs ""half as much more"" on the other two days than on the first day. This is a bit ambiguous. It likely means he runs 3 + (0.5 * 3) = 3 + 1.5 = 4.5 hours on each of the other two days.

**Step 1: Find Desi's walking speed**

* Desi's jumping speed = 3 mph
* Jumping speed is four times faster than walking speed.
* Walking speed = Jumping speed / 4 = 3 mph / 4 = 0.75 mph

**Step 2: Find Desi's skipping speed**

* Desi's jumping speed = 3 mph
* Skipping speed is half as fast as jumping speed.
* Skipping speed = Jumping speed / 2 = 3 mph / 2 = 1.5 mph

**Step 3: Calculate the time spent running (jumping)**

* Total time = 6 hours
* Time spent jumping (running) = (1/3) * 6 hours = 2 hours

**Step 4: Calculate the time spent walking**

* Total time = 6 hours
* Time spent walking = (2/3) * 6 hours = 4 hours

**Step 5: Calculate the distance traveled jumping (running)**

* Jumping speed = 3 mph
* Jumping time = 2 hours

""iPhone Beni is four times tastier than iPhone Ben. iPhone Ben is two times tastier than iPhone Suzy. If iPhone Suzy is 1 year old, how tasty is iPhone Beni?""

Note: ""tasty"" here is likely a stand-in for a property like ""price"", ""value"", or simply a meaningless attribute used for the problem.

**Step 1: Determine how much beeswax is needed.**

*   Rizki can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax.
*   He wants to make 20 candles.
*   Therefore, he needs 20 candles / 10 candles/pound = 2 pounds of beeswax.

3. **Total notes used:**  Let 'x' be the number of Post-it notes in the package she bought. The total number of notes Salsa had available to use is 80 + x.  She used notes on 220 cups of coffee so she used 220 notes total at work.

**Step-by-Step Solution (Chain of Thought):**

1. **Find the number of blue ties:**  Bagas spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.  Number of blue ties = Total spent / Price per blue tie = $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties.

2. **Find the number of red ties:** Bagas bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties = 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

3. **Find the price of a red tie:** Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.  Price increase = 50% of $40 = 0.50 * $40 = $20.  Price of a red tie = Price of a blue tie + Price increase = $40 + $20 = $60.

4. **Calculate the total cost of red ties:** Total cost of red ties = Number of red ties * Price per red tie = 10 * $60 = $600.
